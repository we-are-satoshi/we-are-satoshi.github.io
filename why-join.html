    <h1>Why You Should Join Us</h1>

    <p>Hello Satoshis,</p>

    <p>I started this project as a tribute to the <span class="bold">Legend</span>, the unknown, mysterious, but the one person every single one in the crypto community respects — <span class="important">Satoshi Nakamoto</span>. But did you know, outside crypto very few people even know the name Satoshi?</p>

    <p><span class="bold">This is not a meme coin.</span> This is a <span class="highlight">Community Coin</span>. This is a <span class="important">Mission</span> — to let the world know the name Satoshi, to put the name of Satoshi in the hearts of everyone.</p>

    <p>Recently, I joined a community of $SATOSHI coin — one meme coin that launched recently. I was thrilled to be part of that community. I truly believed it could become the best community in crypto. I created posts, supported it the best I could.</p>

    <p>I had never done that before. I retweeted a lot of memes, but never created a post to promote any coin. It's not that I don’t believe in meme communities — <span class="bold">$SPX</span> has a fantastic vision. Many communities do amazing charity and support work — that’s beautiful. But I had never gone all-in like I did for <span class="bold">$SATOSHI</span>.</p>

    <p>But it didn’t last. Before even a day had passed, the dev walked away. Some community members kept posting, but chaos erupted. Some tried creating Telegram groups, but the dev had pinned a post saying not to join any, which made people afraid of scams. The mod said he didn’t want to do anything. The admin never replied. Then they started shilling other memes. Clearly, they sold at the top and dipped.</p>

    <p>I felt like shit. I sold at a loss — it was only $20, but that’s not the point. I was mad. Not because of the money, but because it felt like a movement, and they killed it. I couldn’t get the idea of a <span class="bold">Satoshi Community</span> out of my head. After a while, I bought the coins again and started posting. I wanted to take over the community. But I had no idea how to do that. I found out you have to pay $200 to Dexscreener. That’s a lot for me. I posted, asking someone to take over. They asked, “Why not you?”</p>

    <p>I tried to raise funds but failed. I didn’t quit. I researched alternatives. I found Dexscreener is centralized. It’s just business. $200 may not be a lot to some, but for us it is. And what’s the point? <span class="important">Community takeover</span> should be decentralized. Paying $200 to call it a takeover? It’s not real. They decide. It’s their badge.</p>

    <p>This “Community Takeover” trend blew up thanks to Dexscreener. It’s a business model. Before, you just started a community on X and built it. Now you pay for a badge. <span class="bold">It’s a joke. Where are the values of decentralization?</span></p>

    <p>So I stopped caring about their badge. Just to change a Twitter link and get a shiny badge? No thanks. I decided: I’ll start something new. On my terms.</p>

    <p>I like the fair launch method of Pump.fun. No owner. Just the community. Even the creator must buy from the open market. <span class="highlight">This is the spirit of decentralization.</span> So I launched $SATOSHI.</p>

    <p><span class="important">This is how it started.</span></p>

    <p>I want to build a community for Satoshi. Now, it’s in your hands. Don’t just buy and dump. Be part of the movement. In the future, let’s do good work — for people, the environment. We need something to represent our growth. Something of value. <span class="bold">That’s the true purpose of this coin.</span></p>

    <p>Let the world hear the name <span class="important">SATOSHI</span>. Support the community through this coin.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">We will become the best community in crypto.</span> We’ll grow, do good, and let the world know Satoshi’s name.</p>

    <p>And one last thing — I’m not paying Dex. I can’t, and even if I could, I wouldn’t. <span class="highlight">They should list us when we become too big to ignore.</span></p>

    <p><span class="important">We are Satoshi.</span></p>

    <p><span class="bold">$SATOSHI is a community coin.</span> <span class="highlight">We are above memecoins.</span></p>

    <p><span class="important">$SATOSHI shall rule the memes.</span></p>
