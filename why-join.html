  <h1>Why You Should Join Us</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Hello Satoshis,</p>

    <p>I started this project as a tribute to the Legend, the unknown, mysterious but the one person every single one of the crypto community respect — <span class="highlight-yellow">Satoshi Nakamoto</span>. But did you know, outside crypto very few people know the name of Satoshi.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight-red">This is not a meme coin.</span> This is a <span class="highlight-yellow">Community Coin</span>. This is a <span class="highlight-blue">Mission</span>, to let the world know the name Satoshi, to put the name of Satoshi in the hearts of everyone.</p>

    <p>Recently I joined a community of $SATOSHI coin. One meme coin that launched recently. I was really thrilled to be part of that community, I really believed in it, I believed that community could become and should become the best community in crypto. I created a lot of posts and supported the community to the best as I can.</p>

    <p>I never did it before, I had retweeted a lot of posts of a lot of memes but never created any post myself to promote any meme coin. It doesn't mean I don't believe in any of memes or community, I strongly believe in $SPX community — they have a fantastic vision. I also know that a lot of the communities do a lot of work to help people and the environment — that's a great thing. It is just that I had never created a post myself before to support any other meme coin. But, for the <span class="highlight-yellow">$SATOSHI</span> community I had gone all in.</p>

    <p>But, it didn't last long. Before even finishing a day the dev went their own way. A lot of members in the community continued to post and support it. But since the dev left it became full chaos. Some people started telegram groups themselves but the dev had pinned a post saying don't join any TG so everyone thought it would be a scam. We tried to contact the admin and the mod. Mod said he didn't want to do anything. I messaged the admin, but he never replied. They started going on posting about other memes. It was clear at that point they sold their bags at top and left.</p>

    <p>It felt like shit at that time. I sold my holdings at a loss as well. I was really mad at the dev. Not because of the loss, I only had around $20 worth of it, but because it felt like a movement at the start and then they killed it. I was unable to get the thought of a <span class="highlight-red">Satoshi community</span> out of my head. After a while I bought back the coins, and I started posting again. I wanted to do the community takeover but I had never done it before so after doing some research I understood I need to pay $200 to dexscreener for it. That's a lot of money for me.</p>

    <p>I posted on the community saying someone takeover this project, they just asked why don't I do that. After that I tried to get some fund somehow but I was unable to do it.</p>

    <p>I didn't want to quit on this idea so I researched affordable ways I can do that. At that point I found out <span class="highlight-red">dexscreener is a centralized service </span> and it's all just business. But $200?? It may not be big to many people but for us it is a lot. Also <span class="highlight-yellow"> shouldn't community takeover be done some other ways? </span> If someone just paid $200 and called it community takeover how is it community takeover? OK, I agree they may be doing some verification or something but it is still a centralized way, they decide it.</p>

    <p>The whole <span class="highlight-yellow">"Community Takeover"</span> thing started hearing after dexscreener. They made it a good business. Before people would have "taken over" projects by just creating a new community on X and growing that community, but now they have to pay $200 to dexscreener and they verify it !? Essentially the $200 community takeover is just to get a badge they provide. <span class="highlight-red">What a joke</span>, where did we reach as a decentralized community? We need a centralized entity's badge to verify that a "Community has taken over a project". Because of this I stopped thinking about CTO.</p>

    <p>Just to change that Twitter link on the dexscreener and get a badge from them I have to pay $200. So I decided to start another project myself.</p>

    <p>I like the <span class="highlight-blue">fair launch</span> method of pump.fun. It is like spreading an Idea. There is no owner, the community owns it, even the one who created has to buy from the open market. For fully decentralized coin distribution this is a fantastic idea. So, I decided to do this.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight-yellow">Ok Satoshis, that's it. That is how this started.</span></p>

    <p>Just know that I really want to create a community for Satoshi. Now it is in all of your hands, please don't buy a lot at the start and sell it at the top and rug it. Please be part of the community — <span class="highlight-yellow">community is the important thing here</span>. In the future we should start to do good work for the poor and unable people and also for the environment. For that we need something to represent our growth. Something of value. That is the only purpose this coin serves.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight-red">Be part of this community, let the world hear the name of SATOSHI, support the community through the coin.</span></p>

    <p><span class="highlight-yellow">We will and shall become the best community in crypto.</span> We shall grow big and do good things for the people and the environment and make the world know the name Satoshi.</p>

    <p>And one more thing, <span class="highlight-red"> I am not paying dexscreener</span>, I actually don't have money to do that but even if I have I am not doing it. They should list us themselves. They will list us when we grow enough and can't be ignored.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight-blue">We are Satoshi.</span></p>

    <p><span class="highlight-yellow">$SATOSHI is a community coin. We are above memecoins.</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlight-red">$SATOSHI Shall rule the memes.</span></p>
