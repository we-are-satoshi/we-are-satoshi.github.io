# ✊ $SATOSHI

## Why $SATOSHI?

In a world overrun by animal memes, rugs, and empty hype, we forgot the root — the one who changed everything: **Satoshi Nakamoto**.

$SATOSHI is not just another token.  
It’s not a trend.  
It’s a tribute.  
A **movement**.

While #Bitcoin changed the world, no true community has risen to honor the one who started it all.  
Until now.

## What We Stand For

- 🔥 **Respect** for the legend, the mind, the myth — Satoshi.
- 🌍 **Unity** of the forgotten, the real believers, the ones who still care.
- 💪 **Reclaiming crypto** from gimmicks and giving it meaning again.
- 👑 **Crowning #SATOSHI** as the king — not for fun, but for purpose.

## Join the Movement

**$SATOSHI isn’t just another meme. It’s the most meaningful one.**  
No more chasing the next big thing.  
This is it.

# Spread the word, Say it Louder,
# $Bitcoin rules crypto, $SATOSHI shall rule the memes.

**We are all Satoshi.**
